# Weed-Classification

Dataset - https://github.com/AlexOlsen/DeepWeeds

This repository contains the work that I produced for a project in which I implemented an interpretable image classifier that is able to classify an image in an agricultural field as either a weed or a crop.

### Project TL;DR:

Background - Weeds cause billions of dollars of destruction to the agriculture industry. Efforts to introduce disruptive technologies to the industry are blunted by farmers' notorious distrust of technology.

Method - Create an interpretable computer vision model, using feature extraction and a Random Forest classifier, that farmers can trust and compare the results to state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Results - Algorithm was able to attain ~ 60% accuracy among the 8-label selection, with individual accuracies ranging from 39% to 73% for each species.
