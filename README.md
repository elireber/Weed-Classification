# Weed-Classification

Dataset - https://github.com/AlexOlsen/DeepWeeds

What this repsitory contains:
• A Jupyter Notebook of the Python code
• The values of the extracted features of the images
• A written report of the results

This repository contains the code that I wrote to classify an image as either a weed or a crop.  It is known that farmers widely have a distrust of technology, partly because they do not trust the results.  To bulid a valuable product, I decided to create an interpretable computer vision algorithm that was able to explain why it came to the result that it came to.  The repository also contains a written report of the results of the work, as well as an in-depth explanation of the methods.
